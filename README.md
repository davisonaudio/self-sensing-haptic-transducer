# self-sensing-haptic-transducer
A Bela project for using a single voice coil transducer as both a sensor and actuator simultaneously 


# To Use
- Select "Code" on GitHub (top right) and then "Download ZIP"
- Plug in your Bela Mini, navigate to the Bela IDE in a browser
- Drag and drop the ZIP file onto the Bela IDE and go through the steps to load the project
- Connect the hardware as described below
- Run the project

# Hardware
The setup shown in this project consists of the following hardware:

- A Bela Mini Single Board Computer with Multichannel Expander Cape fitted
- A current drive audio amplifier (the one used here is from Andrew McPherson's Magnetic Resonator Piano project)
- An audio interface to get audio between the Bela and a computer running a synthesis algorithm (alternatively, the Bela project can be modified to run synthesis code directly on Bela)
- A voice coil actuator - this project should work with many VCAs, surface transducer style VCAs (designed to turn a surface into a speaker) are what have primarily been used for testing
